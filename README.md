# Research: Using computer vision to analyze golfers' postures during swings

## Overview
- **Research Focus**: Using Mediapipe CV2 to detect postures of golfers during different swing phases. The data will then be analyzed further understand strengths and weaknesses of golfers, hence suggesting improvements.

## Spine angle
**Behind view**:
The spine angle remains stable during the swing from the behind view. This is essential for a good ball impact and strike.z

**Front view**:
Front the front view, the spine angles tend to change due to the intention of the golf shot. If the angles increases (especially at impact), the shot will gain more height and spins.
